# Costa-Rican-Household-Poverty-Level-Prediction


Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify. Beyond Costa Rica, many countries face this same problem of inaccurately assessing social need.

A popular algorithm called the Proxy Means Test (or PMT) is used to verify income qualification along with family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need. This is an improvement but accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.

###In this kaggle competition, the dataset is shared with similar attributes with an aim to improve the accuracy of household poverty prediction. 

## In this notebook, I have performed EDA, feature engineering, modelling , compared the model performance and predicted result
